    "## Background of Anscombe's Quartet Dataset\n",
    "Frank Anscombe [1], English statistician, created the dataset in 1973 [2]. The dataset consists of four (4) distinct groups of bivariate data, each group containing 11 points with an x and y variable component.\n",
    "Anscombe felt that the statistical analysis of data through formulaic methods alone could be misleading and that the often discounted graphical method, should be used in order to (i) validate assumptions made about the data and (ii) provide context regarding the behaviour of the data [3]."
